# Card Game

---

In this project I created a game called "War" in which 2 players play. Each of the players at the beginning of the game has 10 cards. Each in turn draws a card. The winner is the one who drew the highest card of the two. Whoever won takes the two cards into his deck.
The game ends when one of the players runs out of cards. Then the other player wins.
